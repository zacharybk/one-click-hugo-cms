    * **Customer-centricity:** The customer is at the heart of how my teams operate,
    how we train, and how we think. Their happiness and success leads to our
    success. 

    * **Data-Driven:** I use data to inform decisions, and ask the same of my team and
    peers. 

    * **Leadership:** I’m passionate about my team’s career development, and
    hiring/mentoring great leaders. 


    ## About Zach:
     I have run global, 24x7 teams supporting customers across multiple channels. I’ve set the vision and strategy for multiple teams within my organization and taught them how to work cross-functionally. Additionally, I have hired and mentored my team members to provide career growth and attained over 90% employee retention.
